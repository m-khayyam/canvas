### Caviats

Visitor pattern is practiced to for loose coupled implementations of Canvas and Shapes. See IDrawable and ICanvas for reference.
Factory pattern for shape instance
Template pattern is used to enforce validations and display on every shape draw. see Canvas Class for reference.
TDD in general and wrote detailed unit tests for TextCanvas and CommandExecutor classes. But due to time factor other classes are not unit tested.
But there are some questions like commands in lower case and few more edge cases. But again due to time factor I left it for interactive session in case.
Due to time factor BDD approach is not used but can be discussed in case.
